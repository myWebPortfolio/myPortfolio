    <p><strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
    <p><strong>Term &amp; Termination</strong></p>
    <p>Upon subscription to the Service, User is granted a sixty (60) day Evaluation Term followed by a one (1) year Commitment Term. The Evaluation Term commences individually for each User when the User is initially subscribed to the Service. During the Evaluation Term, User is not obligated to pay fees for use of the Services. Upon expiration of the Evaluation Term, User will enter the Commitment Term automatically unless User notifies FieldLogix of User’s intent to cancel the Service. Upon the expiration of the initial Commitment Term, the Commitment Term will automatically renew for a one (1) year term, during which the monthly service fees will continue at the same rate as during the initial Commitment Term. User, or FieldLogix, may elect to continue the Service on a month-to-month term after the initial Commitment Term if notice is given to FieldLogix, or the User, in writing 60 days prior to the end of the initial Commitment Term. If User, or FieldLogix, elects to continue Service on a month-to-month basis, FieldLogix has the right to increase the monthly service fees annually at a rate of 3.5% for any provided services. User will receive 30 days notice of such price increases. User may terminate Service after the initial and successive Commitment Terms by submitting the termination request via fax or e-mail. Termination will take effect at the end of the billing cycle in which the termination request is received.</p>
    <p>User has the right to terminate this agreement, in writing, during the Evaluation Term if not satisfied with the Services. Upon receipt of such termination, User is not obligated to pay fees for the Services and User shall immediately discontinue use of the Services.</p>
    <p>In the event that FieldLogix terminates this Agreement during the Commitment Terms for breach by User, the parties agree that the damage suffered by FieldLogix from such breach will be difficult to ascertain. As a result, upon such termination User agrees to pay FieldLogix, as liquidated damages and not a penalty, a fee equivalent to the monthly service fees applicable to the remainder of the Commitment Term then in effect (had the Agreement not been terminated earlier by FieldLogix for User’s breach) at the then-current prices under this Agreement from the effective date of the termination (the “Breach Payment”). User shall pay the Breach Payment to FieldLogix net ten (10) days from date of final invoice.</p>
    <p>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE USER’S SERVICES DUE TO THE USER’S USE OF THE SERVICE FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, ANY COURT ORDERS INSTRUCTING US TO TERMINATE THE USER’S SERVICE, OR ANY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE DEEMED A THREAT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
    <p>All provisions of the Terms, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
    <p><strong>User acknowledgements</strong></p>
    <p>User acknowledges that (i) the Service is designed to store data while outside of a cellular data coverage area, however there is the possibility that all data may not be stored and retrieved by User when within coverage or when calling connectivity is restored; (ii) at times, data collected by the Service are not provided instantaneously and delays in receipt of data are normal; (iii) Location accuracy will vary based on several factors that are beyond the control of FieldLogix; (iv) the Service may not operate in enclosed spaces, in buildings, between tall buildings, underground or in canyons; (v) although portions of the Services (including the on-line service) may be encrypted, the Services (including the on-line service) are capable of being intercepted without knowledge of or permission from FieldLogix or our 3rd party providers by others; (vi) FieldLogix is not responsible for the terms, conditions or obligations arising from agreements between User and any cellular network or airtime provider in connection with the Services; (vii) User’s agreement with any cellular network or airtime provider, terms of cancellation between User and its cellular network or airtime provider may differ from the terms provided by FieldLogix; (viii) FieldLogix assumes no responsibility for improper storage of data or information by User or delivery of messages; (ix) User assumes the entire risk in downloading or otherwise accessing any data, information, files or other materials obtained from the website, even if User has paid for or otherwise been provided virus protection services; (x) Location data will be stored on FieldLogix’ and/or our 3rd party service providers’ websites and databases for a limited time period. User is responsible for downloading and storing data before the limited time period elapses. Data may be archived from such websites and databases after the limited storage time period expires and require additional fees for retrieval; (xi) FieldLogix and our 3<sup>rd</sup> party service providers reserve the right to limit or disable access to the website periodically for maintenance purposes. While most maintenance will be carried out during non-peak evening hours, there will be occasions where maintenance must be carried out during normal business hours; and (xii) It is the User’s responsibility to ensure that data service subscriptions with the cellular provider are adequate for the amount of data the Service will consume on a monthly basis. FieldLogix is not responsible for overage fees that may be incurred due to the Service’s data consumption exceeding the amount of data available in the User’s data service subscription with the cellular provider.</p>
